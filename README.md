# Local-Storage-Planner
<h1>Weekly Planner</h1>

<p>This project is a C.R.U.D. using local storage to save the inputs users enter into inputs</p>

<h4>What I Learned</h4>

<p>This project taught me how to use local storage. After this project I have used local storage in my weather api for things like search history or favorite ZipCodes, so this project was very beneficial</p>
